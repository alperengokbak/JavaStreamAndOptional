# Java Stream And Optional

I've made example regarding stream and optional library of Java. These library came with Java 8. There are a lot of unique method into them. Firsly, continue with Stream, These are methods of the optional class;

- map()
- mapToInt()
- flatMap()
- filter()
- sum()
- parallel()
- max()
- reduce()
- partitionBy()
- groupBy()
- joining()

</br>

I've made some example of these functions. You can reach them from belo the link;

</br>

Secondly, continue with optional. When we cannot find the object we are looking for while making a search function, we return "null" as a return. When we use "optional", the "NULLPOINTER" error is eliminated.
we remove. In this way, we will not get a NULLPOINTER exception error in our programs. These are methods of the optional class;

- ofNullable()
- orElseThrow()
- orElse()
- orElseGet()
